# Hand-Written-Symbol-Recognition

The project deals with classifying a custom-made data set of 
approximately twenty-three thousand five hundred and 
two images into twenty-five classes. Our objective for the 
project was to predict which class the symbols belong to 
amongst the twenty-five. Being a data set 
that contained certain noise, extracting necessary features, 
processing the data to eliminate noise, 
selecting an appropriate model, and designing a neural network 
to train the model to correctly identify symbols were the major 
tasks. After going through various research papers and 
articles, and experimenting on those methods, CNN was 
selected to train our model for this application. Comparing 
KNN and CNN we found that CNN provided a better 
accuracy [1]. Also [2] compares various other algorithmic 
models such as SVM, Back Propagation, 
etc. Finally, CNN provided the best accuracy for the provided 
data set.
